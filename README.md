## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential phase in the data analysis process. In this project, we aim to conduct an EDA on terrorism-related data to uncover meaningful insights that can inform future analyses and decision-making processes. By visualizing and summarizing the data, we can identify trends, distributions, and potential relationships within the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is [terrorism/google colab], which contains information about [brief description of the dataset content]. The dataset is sourced from [terrorism/https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yrIgwcRZvnICI-ylJIKUqhFyXp-qu-9v#scrollTo=R0KDY5bzXHzJ].

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/rakshana-07/LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-05]
   ```
2. Install the required packages by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## Usage

1. Navigate to the [notebook/script filename] file.
2. Open the notebook/script using [IDE/tool name].
3. Execute the cells/blocks to run the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis is structured as follows:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset into the analysis environment.
2. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
3. Exploratory Visualizations: Create various plots and visualizations to understand the distribution and trends in the data.
4. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics to summarize the dataset.
5. Geospatial Analysis: Analyze the geographical distribution of terrorist incidents.
6. Temporal Analysis: Explore trends and patterns over time.

## Results

Our analysis revealed several key findings:

1. [Highlight key finding 1]
2. [Highlight key finding 2]
3. [Highlight key finding 3]
   
## Conclusion

Through this exploratory data analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the terrorism-related dataset. The findings provide a foundation for further in-depth analyses and investigations into the factors contributing to terrorist incidents.
